# About

`pathos` is an attempt to make a system for generating personalized evacuation plans during disasters

## How does it works

*TODO: explain in few words how does it works*

## Building

### OCaml files

`pathos`'s backend and algorithms are written in OCaml. This project uses the build system [`dune`](https://github.com/ocaml/dune).

To build the project, go to `pathos` directory and launch `dune build`.

```

cd pathos
dune build

```
