Pathfinding experimentations to improve escape from dangerous areas

## Escape visualization
Helps visualize evacuation plans and their behavior on a population of points. We're using [`manim`](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) to render simulations. This should not be taken a measure of the efficiency of the algorithms, it is used to get an idea of their behavior.
