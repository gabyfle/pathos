## Escape visualization
Helps visualize evacuation plans and their behavior on a population of points. This should not be taken a measure of the efficiency of the algorithms, it is used to get an idea of their behavior.

## Dependencies

* We're using [`pygame`](https://www.pygame.org) to render simulations.
* [`osmium`](https://osmcode.org/pyosmium/) is used to handle OpenStreetMap data files.
